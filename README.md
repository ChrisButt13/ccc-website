# Milestone Project 1
This is my first milestone project, CCC Crypto Chris Consultancy.
This website is designed to offer my services as a local crypto consultant
to individuals and business. I decided to create this website as i 
have a passion for crypto currencies and could potentially use this site in the future.


## UX

This website was designed for individuals or companies looking for information on how to get started in crypto currencies.
Whether they want to utilise the blockchain in their business or how to start investing or mining. The website includes information about the company and what services are on offer.
The wireframe for the project can be found in folder crypto-chris-consultancy.


## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap 4

## Sources
I used Google to source the images and help with some ideas of layout etc.
All of the code is my own apart from the Bootstap navbar which i modified slightly to suit.
I also took some inspiration from the codeinstitute resume project.

## Code formatting issue
This is a note to the assessor of my project. My code on Github doesn't appear to be formatted correctly. If you view my code on Gitpod i have beautified the code but when i push it to 
Github it changes the formatting. I was thinking of pushing the code to Github locally using VScode but tutor support said it can be quite challenging to set up and advised i left a message in README.
